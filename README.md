# StreamDeckXL_Meta-Profile
A premade StreamDeckXL-profile which contains all the shortcuts one could possibly want preset.

Purpose:
To speed up the process of testing all the commands of very complex software (with freely assignable commands).
The idea is that you can just scroll down a list of 100+ entries and for each commands assign a hotkey very quickly.
Assigning 300+ commands within a couple minutes otherwise would be rather difficult to do and keep straight.
Naming the hotkeys witht the respective command will still take ages, but at least a lot of the work has already been done.
The total number of hotkeys available is 7 modifier groups* (26 letters + 31 F-Keys/special chars/numbers) = 399.

Notes:

Not all programs can use all modifier-groups of course, but in that case you can simply delete the unnecessary folders.
If there's some form of categorization within the programmable command-list, it makes sense to for example assign the modifier-group "alt+shift" to "Edit" and then rename the folder to "Edit".
That way, one doesn't have to do the process all at once and has an easier time actually using all those hotkeys.

technical Notes:

7 modifier groups using the keys ctrl, alt and shift and their combinations.
Naming-scheme is binary-ascending, counting from 1 to 7.
ctrl is 1. alt is 2. shift is 4.
[don't worry about, not important]

Each modifier-group has a folder for the 26 characters of the alphabet looking like this:
      yz
qrstuvwx
ijklmnop
abcdefgh

and another folder for the following keys:

F5F6F7F8F9F10F11
890-=F1F2F3
`1234567
,./;'\[]

Folder names are self-explanatory.
I skipped F4, because in Chinese culture, the character for four symbolizes death and....
Just kidding. Alt+F4 and Ctrl+F4 are just bad ideas as shortcuts, since they're closing windows in Windows.
And I ran out of space. So F4 and F12 didn't make the cut.
Guess the StreamDeckXL is just too damn small :)

All Hotkeys have their text above the default-symbol, have font-size 6 (the smallest, so that one can see the labels better)
and use Microsoft Sans as a font.

sharing/duplication/copyright/whatever

No real reason to fork this project, since it's literally only one file (plus my readme).
Feel free to host your own modified versions of it, that perhaps use different fonts or use icons.
Would be nice, if you would meassage me, then I can link to the and perhaps use them myself.
I only used stock-icons and I don't think ElGato minds that people would share profiles.
So to the best of my knowledge, copyright is not an issue.
Perhaps I should add some boilerplate garbage here, but I don't feel like doing that at the moment.

USAGE

Click "metaProfile.streamDeckProfile" above this text. Then click Download.
If you can't find the download button...look harder.
Then figure out how to import a StreamDeck-profile. And do that.
