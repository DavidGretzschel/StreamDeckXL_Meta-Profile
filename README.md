# StreamDeckXL_Meta-Profile
A premade StreamDeckXL-profile which contains all the shortcuts one could possibly want preset.


7 modifier groups using the keys ctrl, alt and shift and their combinations.
Naming-scheme is binary-ascending, counting from 1 to 7.
ctrl is 1. alt is 2. shift is 4.
[don't worry about, not important]

Each modifier-group has a folder for the 26 characters of the alphabet looking like this:
      yz
qrstuvwx
ijklmnop
abcdefgh

and another folder for the following keys:

F5F6F7F8F9F10F11
890-=F1F2F3
`1234567
,./;'\[]

Folder names are self-explanatory.
I skipped F4, because in Chinese culture, the character for four symbolizes death and....
Just kidding. Alt+F4 and Ctrl+F4 are just bad ideas as shortcuts, since they're closing windows in Windows.
And I ran out of space. So F4 and F12 didn't make the cut.
Guess the StreamDeckXL is just too damn small :)

All Hotkeys have their text above the default-symbol, have font-size 6 (the smallest, so that one can see the labels better)
and use Microsoft Sans as a font.
